**Key UI Changes:**
- Portraits: 100x100px (was 200x200), positioned left side
- Stats: Horizontal bars next to portraits (was below)
- Energy: Top-right corner, visual dots (■■■□□)
- Battle log: REMOVED from main view (can be toggle/overlay)
- Staging area: Central focus, larger cards
- Hand: Bottom, slightly overlapping cards

**Components to Create:**
1. CompactPlayerInfo.js - Portrait + stats + energy in one component
2. StagingArea.js - Manages both face-down card slots
3. EnergyDisplay.js - Visual energy counter

**Benefits:**
✅ More space for important info (cards, staging)
✅ Cleaner, less cluttered
✅ Mobile-friendly layout
✅ Familiar to card game players

=== PHASE 1: SIMULTANEOUS CARD SYSTEM (30 min) ===

    - Can click different card to change selection
[ ] Add "CONFIRM PLAY" button
    - Appears when card is selected
    - Positioned below hand
[ ] Create face-down card staging area
    - Position: Center of screen (Y: ~500)
    - Two card placeholders: "YOUR CARD" (left) and "ENEMY CARD" (right)
    - Show card back image when locked in
[ ] Lock in player card face-down
    - When CONFIRM clicked, card appears face-down in staging area
    - Remove card from hand

    - Then resolve effects

=== PHASE 2: CARD TYPES & PRIORITY (1 hour) ===

    - Counter: 2-3 energy
    - Quick: 3-4 energy
    - Normal: 4-5 energy
    - Power: 6-10 energy
[ ] Disable cards if not enough energy
[ ] Gray out unplayable cards
[ ] Show energy cost on cards

=== PHASE 4: VISUAL FEEDBACK (30 min) ===
[ ] Show both cards face-down in center area
[ ] Flip animation for reveal
[ ] Highlight which card resolves first
[ ] Apply effects in priority order with delay
[ ] Show cancellation effects (if counter cancels card)
[ ] Floating stat change numbers

=== PHASE 5: IMPROVED HAND & DRAW (30 min) ===
