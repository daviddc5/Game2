## **Art Style:** Pixel art, dark minimal UI

## **Engine:** Phaser 3

## **Platform:** Mobile App (iOS & Android via Capacitor), Web

## **Design Philosophy:** Mobile-first native app, optimized for phones and tablets (750x1334 base resolution, scales to all devices)

# 1. **High-Level Concept**

A tense, strategic duel between **Independent Detective** and **Vigilante**.

**Core Innovation:** Unlike traditional turn-based card games, both players **select their cards simultaneously**, then reveal and resolve them based on card speed/priority. This creates mind games - will they play aggressive? Defensive? Can you predict and counter?

Players manage **energy resources** (like mana) to play cards, forcing strategic decisions each turn.

The first player to max out their winning stat OR reduce opponent's morale to 0 **wins**.

---

# 2. **Player Roles**

### **Play as Independent Detective**

Goal: Build evidence to expose the vigilante.

Stats:
* **Evidence (positive):** reach 100 to win
* **Morale (negative):** reach 0 and Detective loses

### **Play as Vigilante**

Goal: Gain public support while avoiding capture.

Stats:
* **Justice Influence (positive):** reach 100 to win
* **Suspicion (negative):** reach 100 and Vigilante loses

---

# 3. **Stats Overview**

Each character has 4 stats (0-100 range):

### **Detective**

| Stat     | Type     | Win/Loss Condition        |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| Evidence | Positive | Win at 100                |
| Morale   | Shared   | Lose if reduced to 0      |

### **Vigilante**

| Stat              | Type     | Win/Loss Condition        |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| Justice Influence | Positive | Win at 100                |
| Suspicion         | Negative | Lose at 100               |

# 4. **Core Loop (MVP) - SIMULTANEOUS TURN SYSTEM**

### **Turn Flow:**

1. **Start of Turn**
   - Both players gain +1 energy (max 10)
   - Both draw 2 cards (max hand size: 10)

2. **Selection Phase**
   - Player selects 1 card from hand (highlights selected card)
   - Must have enough energy to play card
   - Click "CONFIRM" button to lock in choice
   - AI simultaneously selects card (hidden)

3. **Reveal Phase**
   - Both cards flip face-up in center of screen
   - Cards resolve in **priority order** (see Card Types below)

4. **Resolution Phase**
   - Higher priority card resolves first
   - Energy costs are deducted
   - Stat changes applied
   - Battle log updates with effects

5. **Check Win Conditions**
   - Any stat at 100 or 0? → Game ends
   - Otherwise, next turn begins

---

# 5. **Energy System**

**Core Resource Management:**

- Players start each game with **1 energy**
- Gain **+1 energy per turn** (max 10)
- Cards cost energy to play (1-10 energy)
- Can only play cards you can afford
- Cards you can't afford are grayed out in hand

**Strategic Depth:**
- Save energy for powerful late-game cards?
- Play multiple weak cards early?
- Predict opponent's energy and counter their big move?

---

# 6. **Card Types & Priority System**

Cards resolve in **priority order** (highest priority goes first):

### **COUNTER Cards (Priority 10)** 🔴
- **Speed:** 10
- **Energy Cost:** 2-3
- **Effect:** Can cancel opponent's card
- **Visual:** Red border
- **Example:** "Interrupt Evidence" - Cancel opponent's card if Speed ≤ 6

### **QUICK Cards (Priority 7-9)** 🔵
- **Speed:** 7-9
- **Energy Cost:** 3-4
- **Effect:** Fast but weak stat changes (+10 to +20)
- **Visual:** Blue border
- **Example:** "Quick Investigation" - +15 Evidence

### **NORMAL Cards (Priority 4-6)** 🟢
- **Speed:** 4-6
- **Energy Cost:** 4-5
- **Effect:** Balanced stat changes (+20 to +30)
- **Visual:** Green border
- **Example:** "Gather Evidence" - +25 Evidence, -5 Morale

### **POWER Cards (Priority 1-3)** 🟡
- **Speed:** 1-3
- **Energy Cost:** 6-10
- **Effect:** Devastating stat changes (+40 to +60)
- **Visual:** Gold border
- **Example:** "Ultimate Case" - +50 Evidence, but costs 8 energy

**Rock-Paper-Scissors Dynamic:**
- COUNTER beats POWER (cancels slow cards)
- QUICK beats COUNTER (resolves first, can't be countered after)
- POWER beats QUICK (massive damage vs chip damage)
- Creates mind games and prediction gameplay

---

# 7. **Sample Cards**

---

# 12. **What Makes This Unique**

1. **Simultaneous Play** - Not turn-based like Hearthstone, both players act at once
2. **Priority System** - Speed-based resolution creates rock-paper-scissors dynamics
3. **Energy Management** - Forces strategic planning and prediction
4. **Mind Games** - Success depends on reading opponent's likely move
5. **No RNG in gameplay** - Card draws are random, but execution is pure strategy

**Closest comparisons:** 
- Yu-Gi-Oh (card types and priority chains)
- Hearthstone (energy/mana system)  
- Rock-Paper-Scissors (prediction mechanics)

**But unique in combination** - no other card game has simultaneous energy-based priority resolution.
